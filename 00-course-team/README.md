We're a group of UCLA students (in an organization called [ACM Teach LA](https://teachla.uclaacm.com)) who love teaching people about just how *awesome* computer science is! Here's a bit about each of us:

## Lead Instructor: Chase

Hi, my name is Chase, I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at UCLA.

Super excited to teach this class, I actually never got the opportunity to take a CS class until I got college so I'm super happy that you guys are getting some early exposure to some super interesting and relevant technologies that I use almost every day.

First and foremost I'm here to support you, so if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesistate to reach out. [chasekap@gmail.com](mailto:chasekap@gmail.com)

## Teach LA President: Matt

Hey there, my name is Matt! I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science & Math-Economics double major at UCLA, and I'm particularly passionate about how we can use computers to empower people!

This class has been something that I've been working on for the past year, and I'm super super excited to bring this to all of you! The technologies that underpin this class - HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Native, GitHub - are things that I've worked with for years as a software developer and a student, and I want to share these with you.

I've done web development (and other CS things) at startups, medium-sized companies, and huge ones (Amazon!) - if you have any questions about web development, computer science, or really anything, I'd be glad to talk about it! Say hi in the class, or shoot me an email at [matt@matthewwang.me](mailto:matt@matthewwang.me)!

## Instructor: Evan

Hey all! I'm a 2nd year student at UCLA currently studying Computer Science.

I love web development and think it's one of the most accessible forms of technology. Super stoked that you all get to learn about web and mobile development in high school, something my school district didn't offer. I'm also passionate about making tech hiring more equitable and efficient, and think getting an early introduction to the tools and concepts that this class covers is extremely important.

Hope to meet you all virtually in class. Please don't hesistate to reach out to me at [evanzhong@ucla.edu](mailto:evanzhong@ucla.edu) if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to talk.

## Instructor: Lisha

Hi, I'm Lisha! I'm a 3rd year at UCLA studying Computer Science.

I actually started my journey with CS by taking AP CSP in my senior year of high school, which is what convinced me to pursue CS in college! So I'm super excited to join you guys and teach you some skills that will help you take what you learn in this class to another level.

If you have questions about anything at all or just want to say hi, please feel free to email me at [lisha4mohan@yahoo.com](mailto:lisha4mohan@yahoo.com)!
