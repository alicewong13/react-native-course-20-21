# Lesson 1: Welcome & Course Overview

In this lesson, we'll walk you through what you'll be learning in the course, why it's useful, and get a brief taste of what's to come!

## Course Philosophy and Overview (10 mins)

* We've been developing this course with the help of facebook over the past year and a ton of thought has been put into what we're teaching you,
why the stuff we're teaching you is relevant, and the best way to teach you these things while still making sure you guys stay engaged and excited about computer science

* There are many valid ways to learn Computer Science, and different people will gravitate toward different modalities of learning. (Chase and I, for example...)
One of the most important questions we had to answer for designing this class was *What's the best way to make sure that what we're teaching is compelling*
* Originally this class was designed to be more like a traditional CS class, where we explain important concepts in detail first, and then give you examples and excersises later,
but a big issue with lecturing is that it's just kinda boring, and with this class being online, it'd be even more difficult to keep you guys engaged, so we decided to switch things up.

* We decided to make this class project based, which means we're going to be doing some live coding so that you guys can immediately see the power of what you're learning.
We think that the motivation from being able to create something cool from the start will make sure that you guys have a really good time in this class and'll hopefully inspire
you guys to want to learn more outside of our weekly class.
You won't immediately understand everything that you're writing, but I promise that we will be explaining everything that you need to know, so you'll come away with both
hands-on experience and a good handle on some core computer science principles.

* We're super excited about the tech that we're gonna be using during this class, the core of which is called **React**, and its mobile counterpart **React Native**. React is
a system that lets you build really really good websites quickly and easily with javascript, and React Native is a system that lets you build really really good apps quickly and
easily with javascript. One of the coolest things about React Native is that it lets you build cross-platform apps, which means you don't need to write one app in java for android
and one app in swift for apple, it's one codebase for both, and that *saves you a ton of time*.

* One incredibly important thing to keep in mind is that thinking programmatically (That is, being able to translate your thoughts into code) is super difficult at first,
and you can't expect yourself to be able to do it right away. If you get discouraged at any point, try to remember how impressive what you're doing is.
You're unlocking an entirelly new way of thinking that'll let you do things that very, very few people can, and even if you don't end up being a programmer professionally,
this is a skill that'll set you apart in nearly any field you can think of. It'll take a lot of hard work, but I promise you that it's worth it.

## Polls (5 mins)
* Previous experience coding
* Projects that kids would be interested in
* Preliminary questions, concerns

## Expo set-up (20 mins)

* Snack is an incredible system that allows you to write code and then it immediately updates on your phone. In the byegone days, this would take way, way more time.

(Provide tech support)

1. Go to snack.expo.io
2. Click upper right silhouette
3. login->sign up
4. create account
5. Snacks -> new Snack

6. Download Expo Client on your phone
7. Scan QR code. Alternatively sign in with your account and select your project.
8. In the <text> tag, write 'Hello World!' or some message of your choice.
**Congratulations, you just made your first app!**
* If kids finish early they can mess around until everybody gets caught up.

## Asset Demo (if time allows)

1. download a picture from internet
2. drag it into editor
3. delete snack-icon.png in asset folder
4. rename your image snack-icon.png, move it to asset folder
5. Might need to update the text to see

**Wow, that picture's on your phone!**

## Conclusion (2 mins)

* Thanks for coming to class, super excited, React is a super cool technology that'll let you make some professional apps very quickly and easily.
* Next week, we'll be looking at what we wrote today actually works (via HTML and CSS)
