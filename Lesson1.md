## Instructor Intro (5 mins)  

  * Hi, my name is Chase, I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at UCLA. [bio stuff?]
  Super excited to teach this class, I actually never got the opportunity to take a CS class until I got college so I'm super happy that you guys are getting 
  some early exposure to some super interesting and relevant technologies that I use almost every day.

  * TEACHLA is a student-led organization at UCLA that aims to provide mentorship and support to students who want to pursue computer science, 
  either academically or as a career. We believe super strongly that having the opportunity to learn about computer science is extremely valuable, 
  and our goal is to make those opportunites as accessable as possible. 
 
  
## Course Philosophy and Overview (5-10 mins)
* We've been developing this course with the help of facebook over the past year and a ton of thought has been put into what we're teaching you, 
  why the stuff we're teaching you is relevant, and the best way to teach you these things while still making sure you guys stay engaged and excited about computer science
  
 * There are many valid ways to learn Computer Science, and different people will gravitate toward different modalities of learning. (Chase and I, for example...) 
 One of the most important questions we had to answer for designing this class was *What's the best way to make sure that what we're teaching is compelling*
  * Originally this class was designed to be more like a traditional CS class, where we explain important concepts in detail first, and then give you examples and excersises later,
  but a big issue with lecturing is that it's just kinda boring, and with this class being online, it'd be even more difficult to keep you guys engaged, so we decided to switch things up. 
  
  * We decided to make this class project based, which means we're going to be doing some live coding so that you guys can immediately see the power of what you're learning.
  We think that the motivation from being to create something cool from the start will make sure that you guys have a really good time in this class and'll hopefully inspire
  you guys to want to learn this outside of our weekly class. 
  You won't immediately understand everything that you're writing, but I promise that we will be explaining everything that you need to know, so you'll come away with both 
  hands-on experience and a good handle on some core computer science principles. 
  
  * We're super excited about the tech that we're gonna be using during this class, the core of which is called **React**, and its mobile counterpart **React Native**. React is 
  a system that lets you build really really good websites quickly and easily with javascript, and React Native is a system that lets you build really really good apps quickly and
  easily with javascript. One of the coolest things about React Native is that it lets you build cross-platform apps, which means you don't need to write one app in java for android
  and one app in swift for apple, it's one codebase for both, and that *saves you a ton of time*. 
  
  * One incredibly important thing to keep in mind is that thinking programmatically (That is, being able to translate your thoughts into code) is super difficult at first, 
  and you can't expect yourself to be able to do it right away. If you get discouraged at any point, try to remember how impressive what you're doing is. 
  You're unlocking an entirelly new way of thinking that'll let you do things that very, very few people can, and even if you don't end up being a programmer professionally, 
  this is a skill that'll set you apart in nearly any field you can think of. It'll take a lot of hard work, but I promise you that it's worth it.
